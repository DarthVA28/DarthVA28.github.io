This is just a trial blog. I couldn't really think of much to write about off-hand.

After completing a compiler design course during the semester, I thought about diving a bit deeper into systems. Of course, a dive of any sort would require me to have sound knowledge of operating systems, and so I thought I'll test the waters a bit during the winters.

I will try updating this post with interesting stuff I come across my journey. Over and out!
